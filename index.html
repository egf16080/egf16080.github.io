 When I was thirteen I got the opportunity to visit China for a month with my mom. I have always had a taste for travel, even at a young age. My mom was asked to help with a nonprofit called Future Hope. It’s an adoption agency for unwanted children in China, specifically the really sick ones. So, she answered the call and brought her wide-eyed, fresh out of seventh grade daughter with here. While I was there I learned a lot about the value of people. On my days off in the orphanage I would wander around the coastal city of <b>Xiamin, China</b> or drive into the the mountains to visit some village friends.</p></Div>

<div><p>I visited <b>Brazil</b> in the Summertime of Junior Year. We were in a city just outside of Rio conducting a camp for high school students. This was interesting because I was with people my own age that were very different from me. I learned so much about acceptance and diversity. Then norm in slow-pace. To spend time with people, not on devices or in a rush. In Brazil I spent my days off hiking in the mountains with my friends.</p></div>

<div><p>I went to <b>Italy</b> for a few weeks in the summer before college with some of my friends from high school. We started in Milan, Italy then took our time driving down the coast until we reached Rome, Italy. We stopped in Florence, Venice, Naples, Chin Quaterra, Cortona, Nice, Pisa, Siena, Verona, and Assisi. Italy was special because there was so much history everywhere we turned. <i>Italy is split up into 3 main groups: Rome is the city of History, Florence is the city of art, and Venice is the city of art.<i>
 
My favorite cities were:
<ol>
<li>Venice</li>
<li>Florence</li>
<li>Cortona</li>
</ol>
